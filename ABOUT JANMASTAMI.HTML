<h1 id="io"> STORY OF LORD KRISHNA </h1>
<p id="op">The Birth of Lord Krishna:
As the story goes, when the time for Krishna's birth arrived, a divine intervention took place. Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe, decided to incarnate as Devaki and Vasudeva's child. To protect the child from Kansa, Lord Vishnu instructed Vasudeva to carry the newborn Krishna across the Yamuna River to the nearby village of Gokul.

On the night of Krishna's birth, the prison cell miraculously opened, and Vasudeva took the newborn child in a basket and set out on his perilous journey to Gokul. It was a stormy night, and the Yamuna River was in full spate. But, miraculously, the river parted, allowing Vasudeva to cross safely.</p>

  Krishna's Upbringing in Gokul:
Vasudeva reached Gokul and left baby Krishna with Nanda and Yashoda, a cowherd couple. He returned with a baby girl born to Yashoda and brought her back to the prison cell. When Kansa came to kill the child, the baby girl transformed into the goddess Durga and warned Kansa that his destroyer was safe and sound elsewhere.</h1>
